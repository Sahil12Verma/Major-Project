Third eye for Blind is the innovative project made especially looking at problems faced by blind 
while navigation. This project helps the blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by 
detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzzer sound 
or vibration. They only need to wear this device in their hand as a band. The glove is integrated with 
ultrasonic sensor which sense the obstacle in front of blind, if any obstacle is detected it soon notifies 
the blind person giving various signals The project is based on ATmega 328 microcontroller. When 
ultrasonic sensor detects anything in front of it, it gives message to the controller then processes his 
data and calculates if the obstacle is close enough. If the obstacle is not that close the circuit does 
nothing. If the obstacle is close the microcontroller sends a signal to sound a buzzer. Sound changes 
depending on the distance of the obstacle if the obstacle is too close then buzzer will stay on 
continuously so as to alert the person. It also produces different vibration depending on the distance 
of the obstacle.
